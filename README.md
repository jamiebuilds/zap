# ZAP ("Ze'test Anything Protocol")

> A streamable structured interface for real time reporting of developer tools.

**Important!** This specification is a work in progress and is seeking feedback
from potential users and any developer tooling authors. It may change
dramatically based on feedback.

## Motivation

There are thousands of different developer tools across every programming
language. Each of them has their own way of reporting the results of tests
while they are runnning and after they are completed.

But we need some standard formats for reporting their results so that tools can
work together without having to support hundreds of different formats for every
language and tool.

Today there exists two prominent formats for reporting test results:

**JUnit XML**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<testsuites id="20140612_170519" name="New_configuration (14/06/12 17:05:19)" tests="225" failures="1262" time="0.001">
  <testsuite id="codereview.cobol.analysisProvider" name="COBOL Code Review" tests="45" failures="17" time="0.001">
    <testcase id="codereview.cobol.rules.ProgramIdRule" name="Use a program name that matches the source file name" time="0.001">
      <failure message="PROGRAM.cbl:2 Use a program name that matches the source file name" type="WARNING">
WARNING: Use a program name that matches the source file name
Category: COBOL Code Review ‚Äì Naming Conventions
File: /project/PROGRAM.cbl
Line: 2
      </failure>
    </testcase>
  </testsuite>
</testsuites>
```

**Test Anything Protocol (aka "TAP")**

```tap
1..4
ok 1 - Input file opened
not ok 2 - First line of the input valid
ok 3 - Read the rest of the file
not ok 4 - Summarized correctly # TODO Not written yet
```

Each of these has different strengths and weaknesses.

**JUnit** is easy to parse and lots of structured information about results, but
cannot be streamed as tests run. You have to wait until your tests are finished
before generating the XML.

**TAP** is great for streaming test results as they run and can be used to
report progress to developers. But it is hard to parse and contains very little
structured information.

**ZAP** is a new reporting format that tries to get the best of both systems, it
contains well structured information about results and can be streamed and
parsed very easily.

#### Goals

- **Streaming:** Allow developer tools to report test information to consumers
  in real time as tests execute.
- **Concurrency:** Allow tools to be run concurrently across threads or
  processes and allow interweaving of events in output.
- **Structured:** Use a well-defined structure that is easy to parse and
  understand with lots of information.
- **Definitive:** At any given point, it should be clear what state things are
  in: "Passing" or "Failing". When a completion state is given, it should not
  change.
- **Extensible:** Have a clear way of adding additional information to output
  that is still meets the above goals.

#### Non-goals

- **Readability:** It should be easy to build reporting tools on top of ZAP
  that is human readable, but ZAP itself should be designed for machines.

#### Comparison

|                 | XML | TAP | ZAP |
| ---------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Streaming**   |  ‚ùå  |  ‚úÖ  |  ‚úÖ  |
| **Concurrency** | N/A |  üëå  |  ‚úÖ  |
| **Structured**  |  ‚úÖ  |  ‚ùå  |  ‚úÖ  |
| **Extensible**  |  ‚úÖ  |  ‚ùå  |  ‚úÖ  |
| **Readable**    |  ‚ùå  |  ‚úÖ  |  ‚ùå  |

#### Considerations

There are many different types of development tools that would like a standard
way to report results via a format like ZAP.

They generally fall into one of two categories:

1. **Producers**
  - Testing Frameworks
  - Linters/Code Quality
  - Type Checkers
  - Compilers/Build Tools
2. **Consumers**
  - CI/CD Platforms/Services
  - Task Runners/Build Frameworks
  - Reporters (CLI or GUI)

Many of these tools already use JUnit or TAP, however many are unhappy with
these formats and would like something better. ZAP should consider all of these
tools and provide guidance on implementations.

## Spec

### Format

The output is stream of events written in newline-delimited json:

```json
{"kind":"suite","event":"started","id":"0","source":"/path/to/test.js:32:4","message":"DatabaseConnection","timestamp":"2018-07-25T23:47:57.133Z"}
{"kind":"test","event":"started","id":"0.0","source":"/path/to/test.js:36:6","message":"db.connect()","timestamp":"2018-07-25T23:47:57.425Z"}
{"kind":"assertion","event":"failed","id":"0.0.0","source":"/path/to/test.js:42:6","message":"Expected:\n { port: 5432 }\nActual:\n  { port: 8000 }","timestamp":"2018-07-25T23:47:58.102Z"}
{"kind":"test","event":"failed","id":"0.0","source":"/path/to/test.js:36:6","message":"db.connect()","timestamp":"2018-07-25T23:47:58.175Z"}
{"kind":"suite","event":"failed","id":"0","source":"/path/to/test.js:32:4","message":"DatabaseConnection","timestamp":"2018-07-25T23:47:58.201Z"}
```

Or

```ts
{ kind: enum, event: enum, id: string, source: SourceLocation, message: string, timestamp: DateTime }
```

### Fields

#### `kind`

The type of entity the event is for.

- `"suite"` A group of tests or other suites
- `"test"` An individual test case containing assertions
- `"assertion"` An individual bit of logic that passes or fails.

#### `event`

The name of the event.

- `"started"` Execution has started.
- `"passed"` Execution has completed, and it was all successful.
- `"failed"` Execution has completed, and one or more parts of it failed.
- `"skipped"` Execution was skipped.
- `"info"` A info message.
- `"warning"` A warning message.

You don't need to send a `"started"` event in order to send a `"passed"` or
`"failed"` event. You only really need to send it when there is a gap in time
between when something began running and when it completed. For example, a
simple assertion does not need to report when it started running.

#### `id`

The identifier for the entity.

A string which a series of numbers separated by periods `.` (i.e. `2.3.1.12`)

```js
{ "kind": "suite", ... "id": "0", ... }
{ "kind": "test", ... "id": "0.0", ... }
{ "kind": "assertion", ... "id": "0.0.0", ... }
{ "kind": "assertion", ... "id": "0.0.1", ... }
{ "kind": "test", ... "id": "0.0", ... }
{ "kind": "test", ... "id": "0.1", ... }
{ "kind": "assertion", ... "id": "0.1.0", ... }
{ "kind": "test", ... "id": "0.1", ... }
{ "kind": "test", ... "id": "0.2", ... }
{ "kind": "assertion", ... "id": "0.2.0", ... }
{ "kind": "assertion", ... "id": "0.2.1", ... }
{ "kind": "test", ... "id": "0.2", ... }
...
```

This is a flat way to describe a tree of suites, tests, and assertions.

```yaml
- suite: "0"
  - test: "0.0"
    - assertion: "0.0.0"
    - assertion: "0.0.1"
  - test: "0.1"
    - assertion: "0.1.0"
  - test: "0.2"
    - assertion: "0.2.0"
    - assertion: "0.2.1"
- suite: "1"
  - test: "1.0"
    - assertion: "1.0.0"
- suite: "2"
  - test: "2.0"
    - assertion: "2.0.0"
    - assertion: "2.0.1"
```

You can determine the "parent" of the entity by stripping the last `.number`
(i.e. `s/\.\d+$//`)

#### `source`

The source location for the event.

A string of a file path and optionally line and column numbers.

```js
{ ... "source": "/path/to/project/test.js" ... } // filepath
{ ... "source": "/path/to/project/test.js:42" ... } // filepath:line
{ ... "source": "/path/to/project/test.js:42:6" ... } // filepath:line:column
```

File paths should be absolute, lines are 1-index based, columns are 0-index
based.

#### `message`

The description of the event.

```js
{ "kind": "suite" ... "message": "DatabaseConnection" ... }
{ "kind": "test" ... "message": "db.connect()" ... }
{ "kind": "assertion" ... "message": "Expected:\n { port: 5432 }\nActual:\n  { port: 8000 }" ... }
```

#### `timestamp`

The time the event occurred.

A valid ISO 8601 date and time string.

```js
{ ... "timestamp": "2018-07-25T23:47:57.425Z" }
```

Timestamps are used to calculate durations of suites, tests, or assertions. For
example, if you have a test's `"started"` event and its `"passed"` event, you
can compare their timestamps in order to tell how long the test took.
